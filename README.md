Hi! This repository contains a collection of badUSB files for the Flipper Zero. 
The respective template files each contain a set of brackets with [INSERT LINK/CMD HERE]. Replace the entire set of brackets with the link or command you would like to execute.
---------------------------------------
Helpful hints for creators:
Looking to make your own scripts?
Here are some hints.
use STRING [STRING] to input via the keyboard
use DELAY [DELAY IN MS] to delay the next action
use ALT, CTRL, SHIFT, TAB for those respective keys
use GUI for the windows key
an example of running notepad would look like this:
GUI r
DELAY 600
STRING notepad
ENTER
---------------------------------------
Any command or link you could think of can be ran through these, but some require workarounds. I am not responsible for your actions with the given advice. I do not personally condone unauthorized testing of potentially malicious software on machines that you do not have EXPLICIT PERMISSION to use and test on.

Have fun!
